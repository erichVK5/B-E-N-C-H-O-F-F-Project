# B-E-N-C-H-O-F-F-Project

A project to "Bring Existing Netlists, Components and Hardware to Open File Formats"

This a repository for free and freely distributable EDA libraries 

The repository has been inaugurated with the default footprint library from the freeware Protel Autotrax EDA package, along with the freely distributable rpm of CADSOFT Eagle Binary format parts libraries.

This repository is a resource for FLOSS EDA toolchains and is intened to allow FLOSS EDA users to leverage existing community contributed works.

The FOSS pcb layout tool pcb-rnd ( http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/ ) can import Protel Autotrax and Eagle libraries (Binary and XML) directly, and allows export to other FOSS formats such as Kicad's legacy and s-expression formats.   

Enjoy responsibly!
